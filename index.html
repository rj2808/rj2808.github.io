        <p>Hello I am Rakshit, I am  an Applied Physics graduate student at <a target - "_blank" href = 'http://aep.cornell.edu'>Cornell.</a></p>
        <p>I completed my undergrad in Engineering physics from <a target="_blank" href = 'http://iitb.ac.in'>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a></p>
        <br />
        <p>I am interested in solid state physics. I worked on multiple projects along these directions on radical pair mechanism of avian magnetoreception, NV centers in diamond during my undergrad. Look into my undergard<a href = '\research'> Research</a> page for more details. I am currently in the pondering stage of my grad school, thinking about directions to pursue.
