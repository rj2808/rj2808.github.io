        Hello, I am Rakshit, an Applied Physics graduate student at <a href = 'http://aep.cornell.edu'>Cornell.</a></p>
        <p>I am interested in solid state physics. I work under the guidance of <a href = 'https://physics.cornell.edu/daniel-ralph'> Dan Ralph</a> in the physics department. Recently, I have been working on the interplay of charge and spin and heat in exotic quantum materials. My work has lead to detection of magnetic spin Hall effect in collinear antiferromagnets, spin Nernst effect in topological insulators and heavy metals. In the previous part of my life, I worked on multiple projects on  <a href = 'https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0778'>radical pair mechanism</a> of avian magnetoreception, NV centers in diamond. For which, I have been fortunate to work with <a href = 'https://www.iitr.ac.in/departments/ECE/pages/People+Vishvendra_Singh_Poonia.html'>Vishvendra Poonia</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Apart from academics, I am interested in hiking (I completed Mountain Adventure Course at <a target="_blank" href = 'http://www.jawaharinstitutepahalgam.com/'>JIMWS</a>), <a target="_blank" href = 'https://ithacatrails.org/running'>running</a>, <a href = 'https://coe.cornell.edu/lindseth-climbing-center-and-noyes-k2-bouldering-wall'>climbing</a> and <a href = 'https://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/'>outreach</a>, playing multiple musical instruments and dancing with fellow <a href = 'https://cornellsun.com/2019/03/24/a-hidden-gem-ithaca-tangueros/'>Tangueros.</a> </p>
