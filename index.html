        <p>I completed my undergrad in Engineering physics from <a target="_blank" href = 'http://iitb.ac.in'>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a></p>
        <br />
        <p>I am interested in solid state physics. I generally work on multiple projects along these directions on radical pair mechanism of avian magnetoreception, NV centers in diamond. Look into my undergard<a href = '\research'> Research</a> page for more details.
