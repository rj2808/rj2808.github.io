        <p>Hello I am Rakshit, I am  an Engineering Physics senior at <a target="_blank" href = 'http://iitb.ac.in'>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a></p>
        <br />
        <p>I am interested in quantum sensing, control and in general solid state physics. I generally work on multiple projects along these directions on radical pair mechanism of avian magnetoreception, sensing and quantum optics with NV centers and designing new stable and sensitive gyroscopes. Look into <a href = '\research'> Research</a> page for more details.

        <p>Apart from academics, I have been a part of my hostel's tech council in my second year. Many late night tinkering lead us to win the Tech Cup for the hostel. Some of these tinkering activities included opening a DLP projector to see how does it work, creating a tesla coil from a mosquito racquet etc.</p>
        <p>For more serious insights into my life and work, please take a look at my <a href = '/media/cv.pdf'>CV</a></p>
