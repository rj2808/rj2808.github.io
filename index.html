        <p>Hello I am Rakshit, an Applied Physics graduate student at <a target - "_blank" href = 'http://aep.cornell.edu'>Cornell.</a></p>
        <p>I am interested in solid state physics. I work with <a href = 'https://physics.cornell.edu/daniel-ralph'> Dan Ralph</a> in the physics department. Recently, I have been working on the interplay of charge and spin and heat in exotic quantum materials. I work very closely with Arnab Bose (Post- Doctoral fellow with <a href = 'https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/robert-buhrman'>Bob Buhrman</a>). 
        	During my undergrad at <a target="_blank" href = 'http://iitb.ac.in'>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>, I worked on multiple projects on radical pair mechanism of avian magnetoreception, NV centers in diamond. I have been fortunate to work with <a href = 'https://www.iitr.ac.in/departments/ECE/pages/People+Vishvendra_Singh_Poonia.html'>Vishvendra Poonia</a> on these endeavours.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>Apart from academics, I am interested in hiking (I completed Mountain Adventure Course at <a target="_blank" href = 'http://www.jawaharinstitutepahalgam.com/'>JIMWS</a>), <a target="_blank" href = 'https://ithacatrails.org/running'>running</a>, <a href = 'https://coe.cornell.edu/lindseth-climbing-center-and-noyes-k2-bouldering-wall'>climbing</a> and <a href = 'https://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/'>outreach</a>. </p>
